<li class="water4">It survival is not possible. Every day, 2.1 billion people still wake up each morning without access to clean water. This means that millions of vulnerable families around the world do not drink, cook, or bathe with clean water.</li>
<li class="water4"><i class="fa-solid fa-faucet-drip" style="color: #74C0FC; water4"></i>
<li class="water4">For most rural schools and communities, access to clean water depends on outside NGOs (nonprofit organizations) purchasing or “giving” a well. However, there are millions of schools and communities that do not have access to nonprofit agencies or local government support. We must then ask ourselves: “How can we make water available for all?” Something must be done.
